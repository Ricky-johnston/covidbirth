This code allows you to analyze US birth data from 2015-2021 where you can look at the impact on various birth metrics of covid.  
This is useful for anyone who wants to research the following:
1) Look at birth trends in the US over the last 6 years or variaous demographic, medical, maternal behavoiur, mother's health, infant's health characteristics 
2) Anazlye the impact of covid on various birth characteristics mentioned above 

With this code I have alread done the work the work to clean the data between 2015 to 2021 and find the overlapping fields. 
Functions in this code allow you to create tables and plots at scale for the multiple variables in the file.
Additional code does time series forecast using the google causal impact model or personalized BSTS models at scale.
Use this code to make forecast of hypotheical 'what if' covid had not happened scenarios.
